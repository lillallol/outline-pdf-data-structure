## Description

Create a pdf outline data structure from a high level string representation of the pdf outline. [Here](https://github.com/lillallol/outline-pdf-data-structure/blob/master/src/index.test.ts) are some examples.

You can then use that data structure to "hydrate" a real pdf outline data structure like it is done in [@lillallol/outline-pdf](https://github.com/lillallol/outline-pdf).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @lillallol/outline-pdf-data-structure
```

## Motivation

This whole package was part of [@lillallol/outline-pdf](https://github.com/lillallol/outline-pdf), but then I decide to do separation of concerns, because it would make both projects more readable.
